# Visual Effect Graph - Easy Setup (For GitHub version ONLY)

This project holds an already configured HDRP project if you want to try Visual Effect Graph **directly from the GitHub repository** (instead of using the package manager version).

WARNING : If you use this script, you will be exposed to more bugs and instabilities that the regular package* version . I strongly advise anyone who wants to have a smoother experience to use the visual effect graph package* instead.

(*when available)

###  Set-Up

* Download this repository (either clone it or use the download zip button)
* Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and ensure that you use the integration with the windows command prompt
* Use the `FirstTimeSetup.bat` to clone the SRP Repository

Then, you are ready to open the project using Unity 2018.3 (beta 6 or newer)

### Updating

Use the `Update.bat` to update the repository to the latest version. Please note that this will discard any local change you have in the ./GitHub subfolder.
